Locating *The Peripheral* in the context of Gibson's fiction is deceptively straightforward, with broad thematic antecedents from earlier work: cybernetic disembodiment, pervasive nanotechnology, the posthuman drift of unaccountable wealth. But one striking image from the opening pages of his newest book suggests that the most persuasive connection lies between *The Peripheral* and the 1981 short story, "The Gernsback Continuum."

The immobilized 1977 Airstream trailer in the Fishers's backyard where Flynne first accesses the stub is a clear callback to the "Airstream Futurolopis" of Gernsbackian provenance, and the occluded aerodynamics of its metal surface provides an image that echoes throughout the Peripheral, from its direct parallel in Lev's 22nd century Mercedes "Gobiwagen" to the foiled shell of a meticulously-acquired breakfast burrito.

Gibson's fiction has an interest in design: the inherent history of everyday things, where the skeuomorphic do-si-do blithely registers a nostalgia for what once was to come and the veiled threats of what still may be. The echo of this image recurs through the book, implying its own continuum, disrupting both ends of the jackpot with its ghostly semiotics wherever it facillitates contact.

{"In the heart of these words is an entire life's dream. ... to place the great wide world at your doorstep for you who yearn to travel with all the comforts of home.... to keep alive and make real an enduring promise of high adventure and faraway lands...of rediscovering old places and new interests. To lead caravans wherever the four winds blow...over twinkling boulevards, across trackless deserts...to the traveled and untraveled corners of the earth."}

The airstream trailer and the stub it facillitates is of course a fertile nexus of many different contrasts -- not just the near future and far future, but also between poverty and wealth, countryside and metropolis, between ends and means. This is the original double logic of the Airstream as "mobile home": see the world without having to live in it.

As a point of several mediatic contrasts, it is worthwhile to consider the trailer through the logic of interface. But as Alex Galloway describes it, an interface is not a thing, it as an effect, a process, a translation. As such, the effect Gibson offers through Burton's Airstream trailer is one of curation, translating the ephemera of habitation into meaning.

In "The Gernsback Continuum," curation is also the motivator for an interface effect through the medial lense of photography, but further back, the futurism of the 1930s "in which smooth silver shapes like beads of running mercury" provide an ephemeral interface to the future.
