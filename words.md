[1 - thematics] 

Locating The Peripheral in the context of Gibson's fiction is deceptively straightforward, with abundant thematic antecedents from earlier work -- the bodily dissociation of the sprawl trilogy, pervasive nanotechnology of the bridge trilogy, the posthuman drift of unaccountable wealth. But a striking image from the opening pages of his newest book suggests that the most persuasive connection lies between *The Peripheral* and the 1981 short story, "The Gernsback Continuum."

[2 - Wally's Creed] 

"In the heart of these words is an entire life's dream. ... to place the great wide world at your doorstep for you who yearn to travel with all the comforts of home.... to keep alive and make real an enduring promise of high adventure and faraway lands...of rediscovering old places and new interests."


[3 - parallel imagery] 

The immobilized airstream trailer in the Fisher's backyard where Flynne first accesses the continuum is a clear callback to the "Airstream Futurolopis" of Gernsbackian provenance, and the occluded aerodynamics of its metal surface provides an image that recurs throughout the Peripheral, from its direct parallel in Lev's 22nd century Mercedes "Gobiwagen" to the basic form of a meticulously-acquired breakfast burrito.
