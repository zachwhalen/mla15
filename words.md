### [1 - thematics] 

Locating *The Peripheral* in the context of Gibson's fiction is deceptively straightforward, with abundant thematic antecedents from earlier work -- the bodily dissociation of the sprawl trilogy, pervasive nanotechnology of the bridge trilogy, the posthuman drift of unaccountable wealth. But a striking image from the opening pages of his newest book suggests that the most persuasive connection lies between *The Peripheral* and the 1981 short story, "The Gernsback Continuum."

### [2 - Wally's Creed] 

"In the heart of these words is an entire life's dream. ... to place the great wide world at your doorstep for you who yearn to travel with all the comforts of home.... to keep alive and make real an enduring promise of high adventure and faraway lands...of rediscovering old places and new interests. To lead caravans wherever the four winds blow...over twinkling boulevards, across trackless deserts...to the traveled and untraveled corners of the earth."


### [3 - parallel imagery] 

The immobilized airstream trailer in the Fishers's backyard where Flynne first accesses the continuum is a clear callback to the "Airstream Futurolopis" of Gernsbackian provenance, and the occluded aerodynamics of its metal surface provides an image that recurs throughout the Peripheral, from its direct parallel in Lev's 22nd century Mercedes "Gobiwagen" to the foiled shell of a meticulously-acquired breakfast burrito.

### [4 - interior/exterior]

Gibson's fiction has a preoccupation with surfaces, and the design of things almost always matters where the skeuomorphic do-si-do blithely registers a nostalgia for what once was to come and the veiled threats of what still may be. As an image, the recurring, resonating presence of the airstream creates its own continuum, disrupting both sides of the jackpot through its ghostly semiotics. 

### [5 - airstream]

### [6 - inside/outside as class distinction]

The airstream trailer and the stub it facillitates is of course a junction of many different contrasts -- not just the near future and far future, but also between poverty and wealth, countryside and metropolis, between ends and means. This is the original double logic of the Airstream as "mobile home": see the world without having to live there. Move through, move over.
